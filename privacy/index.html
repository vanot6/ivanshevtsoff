        <h2>3. Data We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Contact Form</h3>
        <p>When you use the contact form on our Website, you voluntarily provide us with personal data, which may include your name, email address, and the content of your message. We process this data based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) or for the purpose of taking pre-contractual steps at your request (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To respond to your inquiry, provide a quote, or communicate with you about potential services.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Processor:</strong> Form submissions are handled by a third-party service (e.g., Formspree). Data submitted is processed according to their privacy policy. You can review Formspree's policy at <a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain this data for as long as necessary to handle your inquiry and for our business records, or as required by law.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>b) Server Log Files</h3>
        <p>When you access our Website, our hosting provider automatically collects and stores information in server log files, which your browser transmits to us. This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page)</li>
            <li>Hostname of the accessing computer (IP address)</li>
            <li>Time of the server request</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is not merged with other data sources. The basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in ensuring the technical security, stability, and functionality of our Website.</p>
        
        <h3>c) Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
        <p>Our Website uses `localStorage` to manage your consent preferences for our cookie banner. `localStorage` is a mechanism that allows web applications to store data persistently within a user's browser.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>`cookieConsent`:</strong> When you accept the cookie banner, a value is stored in your browser's `localStorage` to prevent the banner from appearing on subsequent visits. This is technically necessary to respect your choice. The legal basis is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can clear your browser's `localStorage` at any time through your browser settings, which will also remove this consent record.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Embedded YouTube Videos</h3>
        <p>This Website embeds videos from YouTube. The provider is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
        <p>We use a lightbox to display videos, meaning no data is transmitted to YouTube until you actively click on a video thumbnail to play it. By clicking to play a video, you consent to data being transferred to Google. This connection allows YouTube to know that you have accessed our Website with your IP address. If you are logged into your YouTube account, YouTube can associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile.</p>
        <p>The use of YouTube is in the interest of making our website content more engaging. This constitutes a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. For more information, please see Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>b) Google Fonts & Font Awesome</h3>
        <p>For a uniform and professional presentation of our Website, we use external fonts from Google Fonts (provided by Google) and icons from Font Awesome (provided by Fonticons, Inc.). When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. For this purpose, your browser has to establish a direct connection to the servers of Google and Font Awesome, which may transmit your IP address to them.</p>
        <p>The use of these services is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in a consistent and appealing design of our Website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Fonts Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>Font Awesome Privacy Policy: <a href="https://fontawesome.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fontawesome.com/privacy</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries you send to us via the contact form. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the "https://" in the address bar and the lock symbol in your browser.</p>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no internet transmission is ever completely secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to ensure it remains compliant with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services. The new privacy policy will apply to your next visit.</p>
